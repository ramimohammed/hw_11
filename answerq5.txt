Q5

When you make a call to one of the pages generated by 1 and 2 above, the call will arrive at the web server first.
List in a bullet point format all the files that will be processed in the order
they will be processed in before the web server responds to the client.

in general case 

. The browser makes a request, such as http://mysite.com/video/show/15
    
    . The web server receives the request. 
    it uses routes to find out which controller to use The web server then uses the 
    dispatcher to create a new controller, call the action and pass the parameters.
    
    
. Controllers do the work of parsing user requests, 
    
    . Models are Ruby classes. They talk to the database, store and validate data, 
    perform the business logic and otherwise do the heavy lifting.
    
. Views are what the user sees: HTML, CSS, XML, Javascript, JSON.
They’re the sales rep putting up flyers and collecting surveys, 
at the manager’s direction. Views are merely puppets reading what the controller gives them. 
    
    . The controller returns the response body (HTML, XML, etc.) & metadata (caching headers, redirects) to the server.
    The server combines the raw data into a proper HTTP response and sends it to the user.
